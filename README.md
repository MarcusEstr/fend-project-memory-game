## Instructions

This project was designed for the Front End Nanodegree Program at Udacity. It is project 2: Build a Memory Game.

## Playing

To play the game, simply click on any of the boxes on screen. Your goal is to match the images of each square with its matching pair, somewhere else on the grid. 

Once all pairs have been matched - you win! Click "Play Again?" to play again. 

## Resources-Dependencies
